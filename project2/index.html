    <p>
        Hello. My name is Lucien. I'm 18 years old, and I'm a first-year college student.
        <br>I was born in and live in Chicago, Illinois. 
    </p>
    <p>
        My goal in life is to make video games.
        <br>Although HTML isn't typically used in video games, I've really enjoyed working with it; since I enjoy it, 
        I've decided to continue working with HTML and Javascript. This also helps as a way to work myself up to actual game programming.
    </p>
    <p>
        I really enjoy playing video games in my spare time. I also enjoy reading and drawing too.
    </p>
    <p>I also have many pets. I have:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>3 dogs</li>
        <li>2 cats</li>
        <li>1 turtle</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I don't have any good pictures of the cats or turtle, but here's some pictures of my dogs:</p>
