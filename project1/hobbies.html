        <h3>VIDEO GAMES</h3>
        <p>
            Playing video games is easily my favorite thing to do. The video game medium is 
            so unique and interesting; being able to freely explore a fictional world yourself is something 
            that just can't be done in any other kinds of media. Things like movies are 
            limited by time or the plot and often don't get to show you the full picture, while 
            games don't suffer from these restraints at all. The gameplay itself is fun, 
            but many games now tell great stories that rival, or can even surpass the quality 
            of stories seen in traditional mediums.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've been playing video games since I was 3 years old, and they impacted my life a ton, 
            and for the better. I don't think I would be the same person I am now if I wasn't into 
            video games. Video games have even influenced my career path, and I want to create my 
            own video games someday; I even have some concepts and stories ready and being worked on.
        </p>
        <p>Recently, I've been playing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong><em>Death Stranding - Director's Cut</em> (2021)</strong>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong><em>Metal Gear Solid Î”: Snake Eater</em> (2025)</strong>
                    <br><img src="media/metal_gear_solid_delta.jpg" width="150">
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> (2025)</strong>

        <h3>BOOKS</h3>
        <p>
            I don't get to read much anymore since I'm busier than I used to be, but I still enjoy reading when I can.
            My favorite book is probably The Giver. I read it when I was in Fourth Grade, and I've always liked it since.
